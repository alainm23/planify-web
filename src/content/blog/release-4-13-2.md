The new **4.13.2** release of Planify is here, focusing on delivering a more stable, smoother, and customizable task management experience.

## Highlights

* **More control with Todoist** â€“ If you canâ€™t log in via OAuth, you can now manually enter your Todoist token.
* **Improved text editing** â€“ The description area now has a limited height with scrolling, placeholders behave correctly, and your text wonâ€™t reset when repositioning the cursor.
* **Natural sorting** â€“ Lists now correctly order strings with numbers (e.g., *item2* before *item10*).
* **Smoother navigation** â€“ Improved visual alignment for note-type tasks and the option to display completed tasks directly below pending ones with pagination.
* **Stability fixes** â€“ Adjustments to project view transitions, keyboard shortcuts, task duplication, and more.

## Additional Changes

* Added Discord link.
* Several under-the-hood optimizations.
