We’re excited to announce the release of **Planify 4.13.4**, packed with new features, UI refinements, and important bug fixes that make your task management experience smoother than ever.  

## ✨ Highlights

- **Font Size Selector** – Adjust the font size inside the app for better accessibility and reading comfort.  
- **New Recurring Options** – Added support for **weekday/weekend recurring tasks**, giving you more flexibility when scheduling.  
- **“Today” in Scheduled View** – A new **Today section** helps you quickly see what’s due today alongside upcoming tasks, improving weekly planning at a glance.  
- **Smarter Quick Add** – Planify now remembers the **last used project** in Quick Add, speeding up task creation.  
- **Markdown Support in Task Titles** – With the new **MarkdownProcessor**, task titles now render inline code and markdown styling for clearer task descriptions.  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help** – Added a handy popover in the task dialog to discover shortcuts for priorities, labels, projects, and reminders.  
- **Adaptive Windows (Partial Support)** – Initial improvements for small screens make Planify more comfortable to use across different window sizes.  

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Polishing

- Fixed **duplicate sync at startup**, avoiding unnecessary background processes.  
- Improved **drag-and-drop** animations and fixed the issue where items couldn’t be reordered at the end of a list.  
- Fixed **attachment opening failures** with stronger validation and error handling.  
- Improved **shortcut handling** so characters like `@`, `!`, and `p1–p4` can be typed literally in task titles.  
- Back button in the right sidebar now only appears when a parent task exists (removing duplicate “close” behavior).  
- Day change detection is now more reliable, even after suspending or closing the laptop.
