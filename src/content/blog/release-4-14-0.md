---

The new version of Planify comes with some of the most requested features, important bug fixes, and performance improvements to make your experience smoother than ever.  


### üìÖ CalDAV Support  
Thanks to the great work of [@byquanton](https://github.com/byquanton), we‚Äôve completely rewritten the CalDAV backend.  
Planify now works seamlessly with **Radicale, Ba√Økal, and other servers that follow the CalDAV standard**.  
This was one of the most requested features ([issue #1149](https://github.com/alainm23/planify/issues/1149)) and it‚Äôs finally here.  
- Faster and more robust backend.  
- Stable connections even with invalid TLS certificates (optional).  

### üßπ Reduced Memory Usage  
With the help of [@markochk](https://github.com/markochk), we were able to identify and fix several memory leaks:  
- Memory was not properly released when completing or deleting tasks.  
- A leak was fixed during CalDAV synchronization.  
- We introduced a **new cache system for views**: unused views are released after some time and rebuilt when needed, automatically freeing memory.  

### üóÇÔ∏è New Sidebar Filters  
Quickly access new task views such as:  
- **Tomorrow**  
- **Anytime**  
- **Repeating**  
- **Unlabeled**  
- **All Tasks**  

You can customize which views to show, and switch between a **compact list view** or a more detailed one.

### üîÑ Improved Synchronization  
Another highly requested feature: Planify now **respects task order** when syncing with Nextcloud or Todoist.  
We also added a new algorithm that allows **task reordering without affecting performance**, ensuring consistency across platforms.  

### üñ•Ô∏è Moving Closer to Other Platforms  
Thanks again to [@byquanton](https://github.com/byquanton), work is in progress to make WebKit and Evolution dependencies optional.  
This will pave the way for **Planify to run on Windows and macOS** in the future.

## üåü Other Improvements  
- Spell checker support in task descriptions.  
- Fixed a bug when moving tasks with subtasks in Nextcloud/CalDAV projects.  
- Updated themes (light, dark, dark blue) and overall design improvements.  
- Labels and indicators for notes, reminders, and subtasks are now aligned to the right of each task for better readability.  
- New quick-add button in every task list.  
- Beautiful new animation when completing tasks.  
- New sound and a notification when completing tasks (to avoid confusion when tasks "disappear").

## üîÆ Looking ahead to Planify 4.15  

With the new CalDAV backend ready, we‚Äôve started exploring some ideas for upcoming releases:  

- **Google Tasks integration** to expand synchronization options.  
- **Natural language date recognition**, making it easier to set due dates as you type.  
- **An improved Markdown editor** for a smoother writing experience.  

These are not fixed goals yet, but areas we‚Äôd love to explore with the help of the community and new technologies. Stay tuned! üöÄ
